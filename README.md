- If appropriate, [open an issue](https://github.com/kuya32/Realla/issues) on GitHub

## Known issues

- When setting up your location in the account profile, clicking the location edit text view should fire up Google Places API to enter a address the user can type in. Unfortunately, when first entering the address, the app will immediately close the feature.

## Motivation

- Main motivation was to learn how to program in Kotlin. Through this process, I was able to learn how to incorporate multiple features of a standard app and push the limits of what I previously knew about Android development.
- Wanted to learn more about Android development.
